## Testing

```
npx hardhat test
```

### Test Coverage

```
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
npx hardhat test
```

And you'll see and output file called `gas-report.txt`

## Local Deployment 

If you'd like to run your own local hardhat network, you can run:

```
npx hardhat node
```

And then **in a different terminal**

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

And you should see transactions happen in your terminal that is running `npx hardhat node`

### Important localhost note

If you use metamask with a local network, everytime you shut down your node, you'll need to reset your account. Settings -> Advanced -> Reset account. Don't do this with a metamask you have real funds in. And maybe don't do this if you're a little confused by this. 

## Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

3. Deploy

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```
